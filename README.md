# Calibrating RAP data with LiDAR-derived ground truth

## Overview
The purpose of this work was to develop a mapped time series of woody cover at MPG Ranch, a conservation property in western Montana, USA. The products will facilitate downstream ecological analyses, such as identificaiton of factors driving bird abundance. One candidate for estimating woody cover is the Rangeland Analysis Platform (RAP; Allred et al. 2021), a machine learning model that predicts plant functional group cover, including shrubs and trees, across the contitental US at a 30m resolution from 1986 to the present. While the spatial and temporal continuity of this product is robust, in practice I found that RAP predictions do not align with LiDAR ground truth at MPG Ranch. This repo contains the code and analyses for a process to calibrate RAP woody cover predictions with LiDAR ground truth at MPG Ranch. I prioritized the use of publically available datasets and libraries for this task so that it may be replicated in other locations.

## Summary of key findings
The uncalibrated RAP map model dramatically overestimates woody cover in upland grassland sites at MPG Ranch. These grassland estimates vary little from adjacent ecologically distinct zones. This presents challenges for ecological analyses seeking to contrast the relative influence of woody cover between, E.G., grasslands and shrubby draws or forested floadplains. The calibration process reduced woody cover overestimation in the grasslands, which represent the vast majority of the study area. The outcome of the calibration process was a strong overall benefit to model performance enabling it to extrapolate well to areas and time periods outside of its trainig data. I observed a 1.26-fold increase in rank order agreement, a 2.8-fold increase in RÂ² score, and a 2.22-fold decrease in mean absolute error relative to uncalibrated RAP predictions in these test areas. Yet, spatially clustered pockets of woody cover error remained in the floodplain, mid elevations regions with dense shrubs, and higher elevations of mixed conifer systems. It is important to note that, while absolute errors remain in some areas, rank order agreement of predictions and ground truth across the landscape were high. This suggests that detecting correlations among woody cover and other ecological meausures may yet prove tractable as areas of relative high and low cover map as exptected to high and low cover areas in LiDAR-derived ground truth.

## Approach
I gathered LiDAR-derived canopy height models (CHMs) produced by the USGS 3D Elevation Project (3DEP; Sugarbaker et al. 2014) and used these as targets for calibrating the RAP predictions. Predictors of LiDAR-derived woody cover included 2019 RAP data, bare earth elevation data (National Elevation Dataset, NED), and terrain derivatives. For model architectures I used LightGBM (Ke et al. 2017), an efficient algorithm for developing predictive models, and stacked it with a general additive model to account for the non-linearity of the relationship between uncalibrated RAP cover and LiDAR ground truth. For model tuning I applied a cross validation approach where hold-out folds were geographically isolated. To evaluate the calibrated models potential to extrapolate to other years and locations, I sourced additional LiDAR data gathered in 2020 located on the southern boundary of MPG Ranch, which served as a test set having no bearing on model design choices. I conducted a suite of analyses to evaluate the performance of the uncalibrated and calibrated models reported below.

## Description of data sources and generation of derivative products
To generate woody cover estiamtes from LiDAR data ([code](https://github.com/mosscoder/calibrate_rap/blob/main/01_compute_lidar_cover.ipynb)), I aggregated 1m resolution canopy height data to 30m resolution, counting all pixels above a 1m height threshold to establish canopy cover. This threshold represents an important design choice and trade-off, where alternative values less than 1m risk inclusion of non-woody vegetation, such as tall grassess and forbs, and thresholds greater than 1m risk exclusion of low-lying woody vegetation, such as sagebrush.

I downloaded RAP data from Google Earth Engine ([code](https://github.com/mosscoder/calibrate_rap/blob/main/03_download_rap_from_gee.ipynb)), and summed the shrub and tree woody cover predictions to generate a single woody cover product. Earlier analyses revealed no performance gain from treating shrub and tree cover as separate predictors. I downloaded all available years (1986-2023) for use in generating calibrated predictions, so that I could later assess cover change over time.

I also sourced bare earth elevation data from the USGS 3D Elevation Program ([code](https://github.com/mosscoder/calibrate_rap/blob/main/04_download_ned_from_gee.ipynb)), though I chose the National Elevation Dataset product (10m resolution), rather than LiDAR-derived bare earth elevation data. My concern was that LiDAR-derived bare earth elevation data might contain artifacts betraying canopy properties and therefore presented a risk of data leakage. I resampled these elevation data to match the 30m resolution of the RAP data, and then I generated terrain derivatives ([code](https://github.com/mosscoder/calibrate_rap/blob/main/05_generate_terrain_predictors.ipynb)), including: slope, heat load index (HLI; a proxy of solar inputs), topographic position index (TPI; a measure of a cells elevation relative to its neighbors), and topographic wetness index (TWI; a measure of moisture levels accounting for water flow from uphill areas). I calculated various neighborhoods of topographic position and treated it as a model tuning parameter. I retained the neighborhood corresponding to best performance for the final model. Outside of the TPI neighborhood, I found predictors to be mostly orthogonal, exhibiting no correlations greater than 0.6 in magnitude. This suggests that they each had potential to contribute unique information to the model.

## Spatial validation strategy
Two LiDAR missions were the focus of this work: one gathered throughout the Bitterroot Valley in 2019, and a second gathered near the northern border of Ravalli County in 2020. These two datasets overlap at the lower reaches of Woodchuck Creek, offering the opportunity to test the performance of this calibration process in a new area and time period. The non-intersecting regions of the 2019 dataset I used as the training set and the basis for model tuning, while the intersecting regions of the 2020 LiDAR data served as a test set to explore the models ability to extrapolate spatially and temporally.

I adopted a spatial cross-validaiton strategy for tuning the RAP calibration model, where the basis for hold-out sets were latitudinal bands within the training region ([code](https://github.com/mosscoder/calibrate_rap/blob/main/06_assign_latitudinal_folds.ipynb)). The benefit of assessing latitudinal folds is that they allowed me to assess the models ability to generalize to new areas. For a background in cross validation refer to [these materials](https://machinelearningmastery.com/k-fold-cross-validation/?utm_source=chatgpt.com). Generally, a cross-validation approach is useful for evaluating what model settings, or hyperparameters, allow for optimal learning of a pattern of interest. Note also that I have constrained the training areas to a 500 m buffer surrounding the bird point count sampling locations. This was done to ensure that the product would be most accurate in the areas intended for downstream ecological analyses. Only after model tuning did I predict woody cover for the test set region and evaluate it on the 2020 LiDAR-derived woody cover data to guard against overfitting to the test set.

## Model framework and optimization
For modeling framework I chose a boosted regression tree as implemented in the LightGBM python module (Ke et al. 2017). Boosting is the process of adding models in series, where each model learns from the errors of the previous model. When paired with tree-based models, boosting can effectively model non-linear relationships between predictors and targets. Because ecological cover data are rich in zeros, with a long right tail, careful selection of the objective function (the means by which model error is calculated during learning) is important. I chose the Tweedie objective, as it matches the distribution of the zero-rich cover data (JÃ¸rgensen 1987). In practice I found that models fitted with a Tweedie objective correctly represent the rank order of woody cover values, but they tended to underestimate the magnitude of those values, and for this reason I fitted a secondary model, a Generalized Additive Model (GAM; Hastie and Tibshirani 1990), stacked on top of the boosted regression tree predictions to correct for this bias. Stacking is the process of fitting two or more models in series, where the output of the first model is used as the input for the second model.

LightGBM has an abundance of tuning parameters to sort through (Appendix A), and I used a Bayesian optimization approach to sweep across the hyperparameter space to find the optimal settings for the RAP calibration model. I used the optuna python package to perform this search ([code](https://github.com/mosscoder/calibrate_rap/blob/main/07_hyperparam_sweep.ipynb)). Briefly, Bayesian optimization balances exploration and exploitation in a series of trials where new combinations of hyperparameters are tested. Results from prior trials are used as the basis for selecting settings for the next trial. I conducted 150 trials, maximizing the mean of the Normalized Gini Coefficient (assess rank order agreement between predicted and true woody cover) and R2 scores (assess variance explained by the model) across the five folds. Both metrics vary from 0 to 1, where values approaching 1 indicate higher performance. I observed highest performance after 143 trials.

## Cross-validated results from the 2019 training set area
We observed performance improvements across all metrics when applying the calibration process to RAP predictions ([code](https://github.com/mosscoder/calibrate_rap/blob/main/08_training_set_eval.ipynb)). The calibrated predictions showed a 1.4-fold increase in rank order agreement (Normalized Gini coefficient), a 3-fold increase in RÂ² score, and a 2.19-fold decrease in mean absolute error. The majority of the study area had low or no woody cover, according to LiDAR-derived ground truth and expert opinion, and in these areas the uncalibrated RAP predictions overestimated woody cover, between 10% and 20%. The calibration process reduced this bias. The uncalibrated RAP model also tended to underestimate woody cover in areas with high LiDAR-derived woody cover, and here again the calibration process reduced bias.

| Metric                    | Uncalibrated RAP | Calibrated RAP |
|--------------------------|------------------|----------------|
| Normalized Gini Coefficient| 0.600           | **0.841**      |
| RÂ² Score                  | 0.210           | **0.629**      |

By mapping the ground truth, uncalibrated RAP predictions, and calibrated RAP predictions, we can see that the the uncalibrated model dramatically overestimates woody cover in the areas known to be grasslands.

When mapping error across the landscape, we can more clearly see spatial clustering of woody cover errors of both models. While the calibrated model model was able to achieve low error in the grassland areas, areas of denser vegetation were challenging for both models, particularly in the floodplain, mid elevations with dense bitterbrush, and higher elevations of mixed conifer systems. While the absolute error of the calibrated model could be higher in these localized sites, it is important to recognize that rank order agreement (0.84) acoss plant community types was higher than that of the uncalibrated model, and, therefore, detecting correlations among woody cover and other ecological meausures may yet prove tractable.

## Test set results from 2020 spatiotemporal hold-out areas

I also observed performance improvements, though of lesser magnitude, across all metrics when applying the calibration process to RAP predictions in the 2020 test set ([code](https://github.com/mosscoder/calibrate_rap/blob/main/09_test_set_eval.ipynb)). The calibrated predictions showed a 1.26-fold increase in rank order agreement, a 2.8-fold increase in RÂ² score, and a 2.22-fold decrease in mean absolute error.


| Metric                    | Uncalibrated RAP | Calibrated RAP |
|--------------------------|------------------|----------------|
| Rank Order Agreement| 0.599           | **0.753**      |
| RÂ² Score                  | 0.202           | **0.567**      |
| Mean Absolute Error       | 14.591          | **6.574**      |

As in the training set areas, the uncalibrated model overestimated woody cover in the upland areas. However, LiDAR ground truth showed, in fact, a greater amount of woody cover clustered in certain upland test areas, as compared to similar elevations in the training set areas. Here the calibrated model tended to underestimate woody cover in what I suspect are shrub-dominated areas.

Mapping errors across the landscape we can see the regions of error for both models. While the uncalibrated model exhibited error across the region, those of the calibrated model were more localized.

## Visualizing woody change at bird sampling points
With the time series of predicted cover maps, we can visualize the change in woody cover. I observed most change at the elevation extremes at the bird point count locations, with little change in the mid elevations.
