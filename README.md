# Calibrating RAP data with LiDAR-derived ground truth

## Overview
The purpose of this work was to develop a suitable model for woody cover change at MPG Ranch, a conservation property in western Montana, USA. My products will facilitate downstream ecological analyses, such as identificaiton of factors driving bird abundance. One candidate for estimating woody cover change is the Rangeland Analysis Platform (RAP; Allred et al. 2021), a machine learning model that predicts plant functional group cover, including shrubs and trees, across the contitental US at a 30m resolution from 1986 to the present. While the spatial and temporal continuity of this product is robust, in practice I found that RAP predictions do not align with LiDAR ground truth at MPG Ranch. This repo contains the code and analyses for a process to align RAP woody cover predictions with LiDAR ground truth at MPG Ranch. I prioritized the use of publically available datasets and libraries for this task so that it may be replicated in other locations.

## Approach
I gathered LiDAR-derived canopy height models (CHMs) produced by the USGS 3D Elevation Project (USGS) and used these as targets for calibrating the RAP predictions. Predictors of LiDAR-derived woody cover included 2019 RAP data, bare earth elevation data (National Elevation Dataset, NED), and terrain derivatives. For model architectures I used LightGBM (Ke et al. 2017), an efficient algorithm for developing predictive models, and stacked it with a general additive model to account for the non-linearity of the relationship between uncalibrated RAP cover and LiDAR ground truth. For model tuning I applied a cross validation approach where hold-out folds were geographically isolated. To evaluate the calibrated models potential to extrapolate to other years and locations, I sourced additional LiDAR data gathered in 2020 located on the southern boundary of MPG Ranch, which served as a test set having no bearing on model design choices. I conducted a suite of analyses to evaluate the performance of the uncalibrated and calibrated models reported below.

## Description of data sources and generation of derivative products
To generate woody cover estiamtes from LiDAR data ([code](https://github.com/mosscoder/calibrate_rap/blob/main/01_compute_lidar_cover.ipynb)), I aggregated 1m resolution canopy height data to 30m resolution, counting all pixels above a 1m height threshold to establish canopy cover. This threshold represents an important design choice and trade-off, where alternative values less than 1m risk inclusion of non-woody vegetation, such as tall grassess and forbs, and thresholds greater than 1m risk exclusion of low-lying woody vegetation, such as sagebrush.

I downloaded RAP data from Google Earth Engine ([code](https://github.com/mosscoder/calibrate_rap/blob/main/03_download_rap_from_gee.ipynb)), and summed the shrub and tree woody cover predictions to generate a single woody cover product. Earlier analyses revealed no performance gain from treating shrub and tree cover as separate predictors. I downloaded all available years (1986-2023) for use in generating calibrated predictions, so that I could later assess cover change over time.

I also sourced bare earth elevation data from the USGS 3D Elevation Program ([code](https://github.com/mosscoder/calibrate_rap/blob/main/04_download_ned_from_gee.ipynb)), though I chose the National Elevation Dataset product (10m resolution), rather than LiDAR-derived bare earth elevation data. My concern was that LiDAR-derived bare earth elevation data might contain artifacts betraying canopy properties and therefore presented a risk of data leakage. I resampled these elevation data to match the 30m resolution of the RAP data, and then I generated terrain derivatives ([code](https://github.com/mosscoder/calibrate_rap/blob/main/05_generate_terrain_predictors.ipynb)), including: slope, heat load index (HLI; a proxy of solar inputs), topographic position index (TPI; a measure of a cells elevation relative to its neighbors), and topographic wetness index (TWI; a measure of moisture levels accounting for water flow from uphill areas). I calculated various neighborhoods of topographic position and treated it as a model tuning parameter. I retained the neighborhood corresponding to best performance for the final model. Outside of the TPI neighborhood, I found predictors to be mostly orthogonal, exhibiting no correlations greater than 0.6 in magnitude. This suggests that they each had potential to contribute unique information to the model.

## Spatial validation strategy
Two LiDAR missions were the focus of this work: one gathered throughout the Bitterroot Valley in 2019, and a second gathered near the northern border of Ravalli County in 2020. These two datasets overlap at the lower reaches of Woodchuck Creek, offering the opportunity to test the performance of this calibration process in a new area and time period. The non-intersecting regions of the 2019 dataset I used as the training set and the basis for model tuning, while the intersecting regions of the 2020 LiDAR data served as a test set to explore the models ability to extrapolate spatially and temporally.

I adopted a spatial cross-validaiton strategy for tuning the RAP calibration model, where the basis for hold-out sets were latitudinal bands within the training region ([code](https://github.com/mosscoder/calibrate_rap/blob/main/06_assign_latitudinal_folds.ipynb)). The benefit of assessing latitudinal folds is that they allowed me to assess the models ability to generalize to new areas. For a background in cross validation refer to [these materials](https://machinelearningmastery.com/k-fold-cross-validation/?utm_source=chatgpt.com). Generally, a cross-validation approach is useful for evaluating what model settings, or hyperparameters, allow for optimal learning of a pattern of interest. Note also that I have constrained the training areas to a 500 m buffer surrounding the bird point count sampling locations. This was done to ensure that the product would be most accurate in the areas intended for downstream ecological analyses. Only after model tuning did I predict woody cover for the test set region and evaluate it on the 2020 LiDAR-derived woody cover data for a final evaluation.

## Model framework and optimization
For modeling framework I chose a boosted regression tree as implemented in the LightGBM python module (Ke et al. 2017). Boosting is the process of adding models in series, where each model learns from the errors of the previous model. When paired with tree-based models, boosting can effectively model non-linear relationships between predictors and targets. Because ecological cover data are rich in zeros, with a long right tail, careful selection of the objective function (the means by which model error is calculated during learning) is important. I chose the Tweedie objective, as it matches the distribution of the zero-rich cover data (JÃ¸rgensen 1987). In practice I found that models fitted with a Tweedie objective correctly represent the rank order of woody cover values, but they tended to underestimate the magnitude of those values, and for this reason I fitted a secondary model, a Generalized Additive Model (GAM; Hastie and Tibshirani 1990), stacked on top of the boosted regression tree predictions to correct for this bias. Stacking is the process of fitting two or more models in series, where the output of the first model is used as the input for the second model.

LightGBM has an abundance of tuning parameters to sort through (Appendix A), and I used a Bayesian optimization approach to sweep across the hyperparameter space to find the optimal settings for the RAP calibration model. I used the optuna python package to perform this search ([code](https://github.com/mosscoder/calibrate_rap/blob/main/07_hyperparam_sweep.ipynb)). Briefly, Bayesian optimization balances exploration and exploitation in a series of trials where new combinations of hyperparameters are tested. Results from prior trials are used as the basis for selecting settings for the next trial. I conducted 150 trials, maximizing the mean of the Normalized Gini Coefficient (assess rank order agreement between predicted and true woody cover) and R2 scores (assess variance explained by the model) across the five folds. I observed highest performance after 143 trials.
